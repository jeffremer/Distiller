Evaluator is a javascript aware content proxy. Pass in a URL - evaluator will download the content and assign the body to a special variable named DATA. Use the DATA variable in a set of javascript statements and assign your final result to RETURN_VALUE. XML and JSON are automatically parsed. Evaluator will run your javascript block on the server and then display the result of your transformation below.
