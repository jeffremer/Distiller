Distill.me is a javascript aware content proxy. 

Pass in a URL - distiller will download the content and assign the body to a special variable named DATA. Use the DATA variable in a set of javascript statements and assign your final result to RESULT. XML and JSON are automatically parsed. Your javascript block will run on the server and then display the result of your transformation below.
